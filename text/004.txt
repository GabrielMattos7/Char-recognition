The Japanese 51st Army was an army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. The Japanese 51st Army was formed on April 8, 1945, under the Japanese Twelfth Area Army as part of the last desperate defense effort by the Empire of Japan to deter possible landings of Allied forces in central Honshu during Operation Downfall. The Japanese 51st Army was based in Tsuchiura, Ibaraki Prefecture and was thus intended to guard the northern beachhead to Tokyo and the Kanto region. It consisted mostly of poorly trained reservists, conscripted students and Volunteer Fighting Corps home
