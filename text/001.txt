Bootstrappers is the first release by the Bootstrappers, which at the time featured guitarist Elliott Sharp and the Reactionaries/Minutemen/Firehose rhythm section of bassist Mike Watt and drummer George Hurley.[1] On the album, Watt used a Guild Ashbory electric bass, an instrument the approximate size of a mandolin with rubber-band-like silicon strings. After this album, bassist Mike Watt was replaced by bassist Thom Kotik and drummer George Hurley was replaced by drummer Jan Jakub Kot√≠k.
