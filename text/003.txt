GarageBand is a software application by Apple for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS devices that allows users to create music or podcasts. It is a lighter, amateur-oriented offshoot of Logic Pro. GarageBand was originally released for macOS in 2004 and brought to iOS in 2011. The app's music and podcast creation system enables users to create multiple tracks with software synthesizer presets (to be played on a MIDI keyboard and/or sequenced on a piano roll), pre-made and user-created loops, an array of various effects, and voice recordings. GarageBand was developed by Apple under the direction of Dr. Gerhard Lengeling. Dr. Lengeling
